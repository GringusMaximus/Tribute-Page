          <p id = "tribute-info">When I was young, I wanted to be many things. A cook, cartoonist, paleontologist, musician and even a special effects artist. I grew up loving horror films, the masks and makeup were always more cool than scary to me. I even went to my 4th grade Halloween party as Freddy Krueger, blistered face and all. This interest was helped along the way by catching a 1986 movie called F/X on T.V., giving me a glimpse of how special effects artists do what they do (kinda?).</p>
      
          <p>In 1991, Boy’s Life Magazine did a feature on the man behind the hit show Harry and the Hendersons. This was my first introduction to Rick Baker.  I went on to learn more about his career as much as a kid could before the internet was really accessible, and I just thought he was the coolest guy ever. In the end I pursued music, but my love for horror films and my fondness for Rick Baker’s work never went away. Check out the link below for a detailed list of all his work, he has quite the resume. It’s no surprise he’s considered the best. </p>
